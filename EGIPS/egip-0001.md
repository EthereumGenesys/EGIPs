### Specification

Currently, the growth and popularity of Ethereum has grown and exploded, but it has moved away from what we, the foundation believed it should be.

``` python
1. Difficulty bomb diffual
2. Changing of chaindID to 786
3. Creation of Ethereum Genesys Foundation funds (~3%)
4. Proof-of-Stake Removal
...
```

There is a long list of other changes that will be coming in the future that will be properly tabled after Genesys.

``` python
- Removal of gas fees.
- Decrease power per hash while maintaining the loyal GPU & ASIC mining community.
```
### Rationale

1. Long live Proof-of-Work!
2. Replay attack protection
3. ETH2 Deposit Contract will be drained into the foundation
4. Long live Proof-of-Work!
